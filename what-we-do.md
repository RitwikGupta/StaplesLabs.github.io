# What We Do

We tackle problems others have not been able to solve. We license
great content, build systems at scale and use data to push the
business forward

## Our Vision

Use data and technology to drive eCommerce functions to the point
where every customer experience is personal, "indistiguisable from
magic", and each business process is optimized.

## How We Work

We design and build [actual products](/who-we-are#actual-products), in
[small teams](/who-we-are#small-teams),
[leveraging data science and engineering](/who-we-are#data-science--engineering-excellence).
