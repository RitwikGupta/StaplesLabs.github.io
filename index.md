= You Said SparX?

Staples is the world's *3rd largest eCommerce player*. No problem is
trivial. If you want scale, a firehose of data, and the chance to
target *50 million users*... we got it!

At SparX, we are a small team (20 people), operating in startup mode
and in charge of pushing the envelope to take things to the next
level.

We specialize in cutting-edge technologies and we build actual
products that leverage them to impact Staples bottom line: **Big data,
machine learning, predictive modeling, real-time distributed systems,
Clojure** have all been our bread-and-butter since 2010, and we are
not stopping!

= Join the Team

Challenging problems for talented individuals. We're looking for
Clojure engineers, data scientists, devops, product managers, and QA
engineers.
