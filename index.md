<p id="tagline">World Class Engineering & Machine Learning. At scale!</p>

# Did You Say SparX?

SparX is a **[small team](/w-we-are)** executing on the firm belief
that the future of eCommerce belongs to technical innovation and
operational excellence.

We operate in [skunk works](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunk_Works)
mode within Staples, with an exceptional degree of autonomy and tasked
with building the products that will shape Staples' future.

We do not wait for technical innovation to bake before we start
leveraging it. Quite the contrary, we recognize the trend early and
push in driving the technology forward. We have been leveraging **Big
Data, Machine Learning, Predictive Modeling, Real-time Distributed
Systems, and Clojure** as early as 2010. We draw all this together to
build [actual products](/w-we-do), running in production, and which
directly impact Staples bottom line.

The great thing is that Staples is the world's **3rd largest eCommerce
player**. So no problem is trivial and the sky is the limit. You want
scale, a firehose of data, the chance to target & impact **50 million
users**... we got it!
