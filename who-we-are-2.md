## Our Values

At the forefront of SparX's values are ownership, impact, excellence,
freedom and innovation. We focus on results, not rules, titles or
processes.

We are candid and transparent and seek excellence in all that we do.

### Ownership & Impact

  - colleagues *can rely upon you*
  - ops & dev & support & pagger. If you build it, you carry the pager.
 - We do care about accomplishing great work
 - Picks up the trash lying on the floor
- Lead by example

- having someone willing to take that level of responsibility lets
  everyone else on the team do better work too

Judge people on the poise and integrity with which they remediate
their failures -- Theo Schlossnagle

They never say “that’s not my job."

Our teams are smart, inventive and roll up their sleeves to get the
job done.
