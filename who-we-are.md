# Who We Are

SparX is a [skunk works](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunk_Works)
team in Staples, operating with an exceptional degree of autonomy. We
are tasked to design and engineer the products that will shape
Staples' future.

This setup provides us with the nimble and flexible environment of our
startup roots, combined with the backing and the scale of the 3rd
largest internet retailer, Staples. We love it!

## Our Vision

Use data and technology to drive eCommerce to the point where every
business process is optimized, and where every customer experience is
special, personal, "indistiguisable from magic".

## How We Work

### Data Science & Engineering Excellence

Our expertise is in applying technology, innovative engineering and
state-of-the-art data science to the field of eCommerce with
[products that can drive both sales and margins](/what-we-do). We
leverage these skills and experience to attack challenging problems
such as dynamic pricing, shipping estimations, personalized marketing,
product recommendations, and multi-variate testing to name a few.

### Actual Products

SparX is a driver of innovation and change within Staples, but we do
not work in the abstract, we are not a research lab. We design and
build [actual products](/what-we-do), deploy them in production, where
we measure their impact on the business with rigourous testing
methodologies.

This approach provides numberous benefits:

- Business buy-in: you do not have to wait 5 years for the business to
  understand the potential of a novel idea. You can demonstrate its
  value early on, in production, on a portion of the Staples customer
  base with rigourous A/B testing. Not only the solution is already
  built, but you can quantify its impact on the top and bottom line:
  we find it a great way to bypass comittees and analysis paralysis!

- Having an idea is easy. Ironing out all the quirks, executing on it,
  overcoming setbacks, making it scale: this is where true talent and
  excellence comes into play. By deploying our ideas early in
  production on actual customers, we get speedy and direct
  feedback. This allows us to discover the main challenges early on,
  progressively shape the idea to its full potential, and converge
  quickly to something that actually works at scale. We love this
  opportunity to flex our engineering and execution muscles.

### Small Teams

We strive to maintain an environment where everybody can perform at
his best, with maximum engagement and impact.

In our experience, this is not something you can achieve if your teams
grow beyond 10 people, especially if creative work is at play. We are
not alone in this analysis, as a matter of fact there is a lot of
empirical evidence on the topic. For instance:

> After devoting nearly 50 years to studying team performance, the
> late Harvard researcher J. Richard Hackman concluded that four to
> six members is the team best size for most tasks, that no work team
> should have more than 10 members, and that performance problems and
> interpersonal friction increase “exponentially as team size
> increases.” -- http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/7317.html

For this very same reason we architect our software in "team-size"
services, involving no more than 6 people. Theses services and unit of
execution can then evolve at different paces, pioneer different
methodology or technical choices, be deployed at different rates: they
all meet at a well-defined API[^api] and SLA[^sla].

This setup enable us to scale while yet keeping a level of excellence,
engagment and impact seldom found in the industry.

In the same vein, we keep our management extremely flat, team
interactions extremely fluid and decisions are made based on facts not
roles.

## Our Values

At the forefront of SparX's values are ownership, impact, excellence,
freedom and innovation.

We focus on results, not rules, titles or processes.

### Ownership & Impact

Our teams roll up their sleeves to get the job done, from start to
finish, with no artificial boundaries. They are egoless, and
plain-spoken. They hold temselves directly accountable for the success
of the overall project.

So if you design a software service, you will also build it, deploy it
to production, administrate its underlying infrastructure, monitor it,
and even get paged if it breaks! This will give you the freedom and
the leverage you need to maximize your impact, and avoid local optima:
you are forced to consider the system _end-to-end_, and you have
_control_ over it end-to-end too.

Similarly our data-scientists fish for data-sources, clean-up the
data, build and debug models, monitor the models while they are
running in production, and report on their business performance. Some
of our data-scientists can even implement the runtime to execute these
models in production with a 1ms SLA!

Finally our product people decipher the industry, reverse-engineer
Staples' business and data flows, build bridges with important
partners, secure top executive committments, keep the projects on
schedule and on track, all while keeping an eye on our business
metrics!

So, at SparX, _ownership_ is not an empty word, we do all care
_intensely_ about accomplishing _great_ work.

The amazing thing is to be part of a team with that level of
committment, responsibility and accountability is that it is an
amazing enabler. When everybody picks up whatever trash is lying on
the floor, it fosters your capacity to truly innovate.

### Bias for Action, Results & Fact-based Decisions

Speed matters in business and to get tangible feedback you need to
execute. This is why we have such a strong bias to action, we mimimize
meetings and emphasize fast delivery. We release to production
multiple times a week. We quickly start our projects on a small scale,
then grow them progressively to their full potential, learning along
the way.

We also focus on great results, rather than on rules or on
process. So, as long they can demonstrate great results, each team
gets a lot of freedom in how it operates and in its technical choices.

Being result-oriented also means that we measure what we do, look at
the data, and surrender quickly to evidence when we are wrong. We are
not afraid of being mistaken and change the course of action along the
way, based on facts.

Finally, another benefit of basing decisions on facts & data is that
it makes hierachy and roles completely irrevelants. The most junior
person in the team can win a debate with the head of the office.

### Freedom to Excel

We seek excellence in all we do, and work hard in forging an
environment that nutures it.

The first way you get a unique opportunity to excel, is by getting a
chance to work on extremely challenging problems -- day in and day
out. For instance:

- Modeling customer behavior on an individual basis, to the point
  where you can literally predict their action.
- Boosting brand, sales & margin at the same time.
- Shaping customer behavior and current traffic in order to align them
  with where Staples' wants to position itself for the next 10 years.
- Conduct a lot of concurrent experiments at any point of time, and
  quickly reach statistical significance, but without sacrificing
  significant traffic or profits.
- Building near real-time machine learning services with a 1ms
  SLA[^SLA] -- as in 99% of the API requests complete under one
  millisecond.

These problems cannot be brute-forced, their require creativity,
intelligence, and impecable execution. Wherever you currently stand,
you _will_ feel challenged, and discover you end up achieving things
you previously thought impossible.

The second way we foster excellence is by providing you with the
freedom you need to learn and experiment:

- Our small team size means that you do not have to convince 30 people
  before you can start experimenting on an idea at a small
  scale. Secure buy-in from a few people in your team and run with
  it. Not all teams need to go at the same pace or in the same
  direction: this is the whole point!

- Since you know everybody has your back, you can focus on doing your
  _best_ as opposed to worrying about trying to look good.

- We are ego-less and silo-less when searching for the best ideas: you
  can contribute effectively outside of your specialty or current
  assignment.

- We provide sustainable working hours, so that you can recharge,
  learn new things on your own, think about it in the shower, and come
  back the next day with your all your curiosity and brainpower.

- We support rapid, eager and active learning by taking the time to
  help our colleagues, by sharing information openly and proactively,
  by getting frequent & direct feedback from our peers, by leveraging
  pair-programming when appropriate, by taking our role in coaching
  other very seriously, and also with a bias for colocation and
  in-person communication.

Finally, the last thing that makes SparX is a great place to seek
excellence is _inspiration_:

- We are obsessed with finding, recognizing and recruiting exceptional
  talent. This makes SparX a great workplace, with stunning
  colleagues, who never fail to inspire you with their skills and
  their thrust for excellence.

- This natural dynamic is further reinforced by our flat structure,
  where people lead by example.

### Discipline

With great powers comes great responsibilities. We provide the freedom
to experiment, innovate and excel. But, at the same time, it must come
with a lot of operational rigor and discipline for things to be
sustainable and avoid harmful failures. Especially when you are
experimenting in production, will real dollars!

- So the fabric of our team is the capacity to, at the same time:
  - _thrive_ on freedom
  - be _worthy_ of freedom
- We monitor all experiments with rigourous multi-variate testing and
  abort them early if necessary: before they become too harmful to the
  customer experience or bottom line.
- We automate all the boring processes to minimize the risk for error.
- While we think big, we introduce changes in a controlled and gradual
  manner. Be it at the code level, the system level or the product
  level.

### Dive Deep, Invent & Simplify

When applying your knowledge to challenging real world problems and
pioneering new solutions, you cannot just stay at the surface, you
cannot just settle for the original formulation.

Our teams have the capacity to dive very deep, operate at all levels
while stay connected to the details, and challenge prevailing
assumptions when waranted.

Leaders , and
audit frequently. No task is beneath them.

  - Identify root causes and get beyond treating symptoms


- require innovation and invention from their teams and always find
  ways to simplify

  - *Challenge prevailing assumptions* when warranted, and *suggest
     better approaches*

  - Re-conceptualize issues to *discover practical solutions to hard
    problems*

  - Create new ideas that prove useful

  - *Keep us nimble by minimizing complexity and finding time to simplify*



- focus on fundamental, not chase the latest fashion

We strive for ingenuity and simplicity, always keeping the customer in
mind.
