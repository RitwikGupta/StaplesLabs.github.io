# Who We Are

SparX is a [skunk works](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunk_Works)
team in Staples, operating with an exceptional degree of autonomy and
tasked to design and engineer the products that will shape Staples'
future.

This setup provides us the nimble and flexible environment of our
startup roots, with the backing and the scale of the 3rd largest
internet retailer, Staples.

## Our Vision

Use data and technology to drive eCommerce to the point where every
customer experience is special, personal, "indistiguisable from
magic", and where each business process is optimized.

## How We Work

### Data Science & Engineering Excellence

Our expertise is in applying technology, innovative engineering and
state-of-the-art data science to the field of eCommerce with
[products that can drive both sales and margins](/what-we-do). We
leverage these skills and experience to attack challenging problems
such as dynamic pricing, shipping estimations, personalized marketing,
product recommendations, and multi-variate testing to name a few.

### Actual Products

SparX is a driver of innovation and change within Staples, but we are
not a research lab, we do not work in the abstract. We design and
build [actual products](/what-we-do), deploy them in production, where
we measure in real-life their impact on the business with rigourous
testing methodologies.

This approach provides numberous benefits:

- Business buy-in: you do not have to wait 5 years for the business to
  understand the potential of a novel idea. You can demonstrate its
  value early on in production on a portion of the Staples customer
  base. Not only the solution is already built, but you can quantify
  its impact on the top and bottom line: this is a great way to bypass
  comittees and analysis paralysis!

- Having an idea is easy: ironing out all the quirks, executing on it,
  making it scale, this is where true talent and excellence comes into
  play. By deploying our ideas early in production on actual
  customers, we get speedy and direct feedback. This allows us to
  discover the main challenges early on, and converge quickly to
  something that actually works at scale. We love this opportunity to
  flex our engineering and execution muscles.
