## Software Engineer

### Introduction

SparX is a small engineering team focused on applying online machine
learning and predictive modeling to eCommerce (impacting a 24 billion
dollar business).

Our stack is 100% Clojure, service oriented, targeting 50 million
users with 1ms SLAs. We apply engineering and data science to tough
problems such as dynamic pricing, shipping estimations, personalized
emails, and multi-variate testing.

We are always looking for talent in data-science, engineering and
devops. Bonus points if you can bridge 2 of these together. We love
people with strong fundamentals who can dive deep.

We're a small team, so you will have an opportunity for a high-impact
role, targeting over 50 million users. But our best perk is our
colleagues: a diverse and extremely talented team of stunning
engineers, data-scientists and eCommerce experts.

We are located in San Mateo, walking distance from the Cal-Train
station. Come visit or apply online at http://staples-sparx.com.
