## Software Engineer

### Introduction

SparX is a small engineering team focused on applying online machine
learning and predictive modeling to eCommerce (impacting a 24 billion
dollar business). Our stack is 100% Clojure, service oriented,
targeting 50 million users with 1ms SLAs. We apply engineering and
data science to tough problems such as dynamic pricing, shipping
estimations, personalized emails, and multi-variate testing. We are
always looking for talent in data-science, engineering and
devops. Bonus points if you can bridge 2 of these together. We love
people with strong fundamentals who can dive deep.

We're a small team, so you will have an opportunity for a high-impact
role, targeting over 50 million users. But our best perk is our
colleagues: a diverse and extremely talented team of seasoned
engineers and data-scientists.

We are located in San Mateo, walking distance from the Cal-Train
station. Come visit or apply online at http://staples-sparx.com.
